**Abao** is a command-line tool for testing API documentation written in [RAML][] format against its backend implementation. With **Abao** you can easily plug your API documentation into the Continous Integration system like Travis CI or Jenkins and have API documentation up-to-date, all the time. Abao uses the [Mocha][] for judging if a particular API response is valid or if is not.

## Features

- Verify that each endpoint defined in RAML exists in service
- Verify that each endpoint url params defined in RAML are supported in service
- Verify that each endpoint request HTTP headers defined in RAML are supported in service
- Verify that each endpoint request body defined in RAML is supported in service - verify by validating the JSON schema
- Verify that each endpoint response HTTP headers defined in RAML are supported in service
- Verify that each endpoint response body defined in RAML is supported in service - verify by validating the JSON schema
- Verify test data defined in files which support defining multiple test cases - verify based on [test case definition](#test-case-definition)

## Installation

Install stable version

    npm install -g frontnode/abao

## Get Started

    abao api.raml config.json

## Test part of your APIs

    abao api.raml config.json -g /cap

## Writing testable RAML

**Abao** validates the response from server against jsonschema defines in [RAML][], so there must be **schema** section in defined in [RAML][].

### Test Case definition

#### Basic definition

Every test case is defined based on configuration (JSON format), the resource path is mapped to the related folder path, examples below:

```
# Pattern
method path status -> Test folder path

# Handle single resouce
GET /members/{id} 200 -> test/members/detail/get/200
GET /members/{id} 422 -> test/members/detail/get/422
POST /members/{id} 200 -> test/members/detail/get/200
PUT /members/{id} 200 -> test/members/detail/get/200
DELETE /members/{id} 200 -> test/members/detail/get/200

# Batch operations
GET /members 200 -> test/members/get/200
POST /members 200 -> test/members/post/200
PUT /members 200 -> test/members/put/200
DELETE /members 200 -> test/members/delete/200
```

**Notice:** The detail type API (like `/resource/{id}`) should be place the detail folder in `test/resource` folder, just as the mapping relationship example shown above.

Test case file name can be defined as any name you like, but you had better use the case desription as the name to make it more clear, example file `invalid-email.json`, the test case definition only check response based on your request parameters.

```
{
  "params": {
    "email": "test"
  },
  "response": {
    "body": {
      "message": "not found"
    }
  }
}
```

Test case is defined as JSON format, these parameters are optional based on your needs:

- `params` - URI parameters, parsed from RAML `uriParameters` section, default to `{}`.
- `query` - object containing querystring values to be appended to the `path`, default to `{}`.
- `headers` - http headers, parsed from RAML `headers` section, default to `{'Content-Type': 'application/json'}`.
- `body` - entity body for PATCH, POST and PUT requests. Must be a JSON-serializable object. Parsed from RAML `example` section, default to `{}`

- `response.status` - Expected http response code, parsed from RAML.
- `response.body` - http json body got from testing server. default to `null`
- `response.schema` - Expected schema of http response, parsed from RAML `schema` section.
- `response.headers` - Headers object got from testing server, default to `{}`

If you just want to validate the response match the schema definition, just define the input you need, abao will do the rest.

```
{
  "params": {
    "email": "iqixing00005@163.com"
  }
}
```

**Notice:** If you don't need to pass anything for the API, you can just put an empty file.

#### Data verification rule

The tool verify response data in two ways.

1. Verify the schema defined in RAML file (check required field and field type)

Take the schema defined in raml folder below as a simple example.

```
{
  "id": "user"
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "id": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "User name"
    },
    "name": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "User name"
    },
    "friends": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "id": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "User ID"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema",
  "required": [
    "id"
    "name"
  ]
}
```

`abao` will verify that the response is an object and the object has two required field `id` and `name`, and their type are `string`. The `friend` field type is also checke if the response contains the field.

2. Verify that the response body deep matches if the body field is defined in the test case JSON file **(the example defined in RAML will not be used)**.

Take the test case defined in `test` folder as a simple example:

```
{
  "params": {
    "email": "test"
  },
  "response": {
    "body": {
      "message": "not found"
    }
  }
}
```

`abao` will verify that the response is an object and the field is deeply equaled.

#### Add case dependencies

Sometimes your test case may depend on other cases:

* The test case result in database updation, and your case depend on it
* The test case will return some data used in another case (Not supported yet)

You can specify it with `depends` field:

```
{
  "params": {
    "email": "iqixing00005@163.com"
  },
  "depends": {
    "path": "/users",
    "method": "POST",
    "status": 200,
    "case": "normal.json"
  }
}
```

The `depends` field can be either an object or and object array (depend on multiple cases), the value should the case file path under `base test folder`.

#### Clear database data

##### Basic usage

Only mongoDB is supported now, the DSN for mongoDB is configured in the `config.json` file specified in command

```
{
  "db": {
    "type": "mongodb",
    "dsn": "username:password@example.com/mydb"
  }
}
```

You just need to define the query condition for mongo to find the data you want to remove after the test

```
{
  "body": {
    "name": "testuser",
    "avatar": "http://static.image.com/test.png"
  },
  "destroy": {
    "model": "user",
    "query": {
      "name": "testuser"
    }
  }
}
```

The `destroy` field support both array and object, in case that you may need to clear multiple records.

**Notice:** 

* You can use `depends` and `destroy` together, if the depended case has `destroy` field, the actual destraction is executed after the next case is run (so that the next case can rely on the depend case database modification). 

* The `query` field named as `_id` or `xxxId` will be transformed as mongo ID automatically, you just need to specify the mongo ID HEX value. You don't need to add `account_id` field as filter, because it is configured in the `config.json` file when command is executed.

* If you don't need the default transformaion for `_id` or `xxxId` field and keep the raw value, you can set the value starting with `!` symbol as the example below:

```
{
  "body": {
    "name": "Vincent",
    "phone": "13345345636"
  },
  "destroy": {
    "model": "user",
    "query": {
      "userId": "!555ed85513747345"
    }
  }
}
```

The query will use `555ed85513747345` as userId value to delete record.

##### Advanced Usage

If you just need to revert the updation for records, you can use `update` field to indicate that this is only an operation for updating records instead of removing records.

```
{
  "body": {
    "name": "testuser",
    "avatar": "http://static.image.com/test.png"
  },
  "destroy": {
    "model": "user",
    "query": {
      "name": "testuser"
    },
    "update": {
      "$set": {
        "name": "olduser"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `destroy` field support both array and object, so that you can remove records and update records at the same time.

**Notice:**

* You can use `depends` and `destroy` together, if the depended case has `destroy` field, the actual destraction is executed after the next case is run (so that the next case can rely on the depend case database modification). 

* The `query` field named as `_id` or `xxxId` will be transformed as mongo ID automatically, you just need to specify the mongo ID HEX value. You don't need to add `account_id` field as filter, because it is configured in the `config.json` file when command is executed.

* If you don't need the default transformaion for `_id` or `xxxId` field and keep the raw value, you can set the value starting with `!` symbol as the example below:

```
{
  "body": {
    "name": "Vincent",
    "phone": "13345345636"
  },
  "destroy": {
    "model": "user",
    "query": {
      "userId": "!555ed85513747345"
    }
  }
}
```

The query will use `555ed85513747345` as userId value to delete record.

##### Refer response body in query

You may need to refer the response body got from test case (create a member and refer created member ID), you can use `$` to refer it directly in `destroy` field.

```
{
  "body": {
    "name": "Vincent",
    "phone": "13345345636"
  },
  "destroy": {
    "model": "user",
    "query": {
      "_id": "$member_id"
    }
  }
}
```

The `member_id` field is got from test case response data, as the example below:

```
{
  "member_id": "555ed85513747345628b4581"
}
```

#### Basic load test

If you specify the `loadtest` field in the case definition, you can make basic load test. The `loadtest` field is an options object, you can find related options [here](https://github.com/alexfernandez/loadtest#options). See example below:

```
{
  "params": {
    "email": "iqixing00005@163.com"
  },
  "loadtest": {
    "concurrency": 1000,
    "maxRequests": 1000,
    "maxSeconds": 5
  }
}
```

**Notice:** 

* The default content type is 'application/json' if `contentType` field is not specified
* The max seconds for load test is 10s
* If no options is specified, the loadtest will make a 2s duration testing with one concurrency, and show the tips for you as the example below.


```
  GET /members -> 200 : test/members/get/200/normal
[warn] Loadtest field should be the configuration used by loadtest
[warn] Options reference: https://github.com/alexfernandez/loadtest#options
----Load test result below----
{
  "totalRequests": 124,
  "totalErrors": 0,
  "totalTimeSeconds": 2.002956715,
  "rps": 62,
  "meanLatencyMs": 20,
  "maxLatencyMs": 268,
  "percentiles": {
    "50": 7,
    "90": 11,
    "95": 28,
    "99": 266
  },
  "errorCodes": {}
}

```

Normally you can use the options you need to test your API and got the result below:

```
-----------Load test result below------------
{
  "totalRequests": 10,
  "totalErrors": 0,
  "totalTimeSeconds": 0.079664075,
  "rps": 126,
  "meanLatencyMs": 10,
  "maxLatencyMs": 12,
  "percentiles": {
    "50": 7,
    "90": 12,
    "95": 12,
    "99": 12
  },
  "errorCodes": {}
}
```

**Notice:** Currently you can only verify the load test result yourself

## Hooks

**Abao** can be configured to use hookfiles to do basic setup/teardown between each validation (specified with the --hookfiles flag). Hookfiles can be in javascript or coffeescript, and must import the hook methods.

**NOTE**: The hookfile's extension must be `.coffee` if it's written in coffeescript.

Requests are identified by their name, which is derived from the structure of the RAML. You can print a list of the generated names with --names.

### Example

Get Names:

```bash
$ abao single-get.raml --names
GET /machines -> 200
```

Write a hookfile in **JavaScript**:

```js
var hooks = require('hooks');

hooks.before('GET /machines -> 200', function(test, done) {
    test.request.query = {color: 'red'};
    done();
});

hooks.after('GET /machines -> 200', function(test, done) {
    machine = test.response.body[0];
    console.log(machine.name);
    done();
});
```

Write a hookfile in **CoffeeScript**:

```coffee
{before, after} = require 'hooks'

before 'GET /machines -> 200', (test, done) ->
  test.request.query =
    color: 'red'
  done()

after 'GET /machines -> 200', (test, done) ->
  machine = test.response.body[0]
  console.log machine.name
  done()
```

Run validation:

```bash
$ abao single-get.raml http://api.example.com --hookfiles=*_hooks.*
```

**Abao** also supports callbacks before and after all tests:

```coffee
{beforeAll, afterAll} = require 'hooks'

beforeAll (done) ->
  # do setup
  done()

afterAll (done) ->
  # do teardown
  done()
```

If `beforeAll`, `afterAll`, `before` and `after` are called multiple times, the callbacks are executed serially in the order they were called.

### test.request

- `server` - Server address, provided from CLI.
- `path` - API endpoint path, parsed from RAML.
- `method` - http method, parsed from RAML.
- `params` - URI parameters, parsed from RAML `uriParameters` section, default to `{}`.
- `query` - object containing querystring values to be appended to the `path`, default to `{}`.
- `headers` - http headers, parsed from RAML `headers` section, default to `{}`.
- `body` - entity body for PATCH, POST and PUT requests. Must be a JSON-serializable object. Parsed from RAML `example` section, default to `{}`

### test.response

- `status` - Expected http response code, parsed from RAML.
- `schema` - Expected schema of http response, parsed from RAML `schema` section.
- `headers` - Headers object got from testing server, default to `{}`
- `body` - http json body got from testing server. default to `null`
